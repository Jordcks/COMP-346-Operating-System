These following reasons can explain the different running times:
1. External program or processes running outside this software may
have an impact on the individual thread running time each time we run
our program.
2. There is a difference in running times of the Normal Runs (with the
provided account.txt and transaction.txt) because of the Java
Scheduler. Each thread is signal to the Java Virtual Machine as
needing to run, but ultimately, we cannot control how the scheduler
assigns execution time to the threads. Therefore, some threads on
certain run will get execution time earlier than others.
3. Hardware performances can also impact thread running time, if the
program is running with different CPUs.
4. These difference can also depend on the performance of the CPU.
